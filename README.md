# SideScrolling JavaScript Project

**Project Description:** This is a JavaScript project that implements a side-scrolling game. The game consists of a player character controlled by the user, and platforms that the player can jump on. The goal is to navigate the player character to reach the end of the level. The project utilizes HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript to create the game environment and handle player movements and collisions.

## Installation

To run the SideScrolling JavaScript Project, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) on your local machine.

2. Copy the following code into the HTML file:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>SideScrolling JavaScript Project</title>
       <style>
           body {
               margin: 0;
               overflow: hidden;
           }
   
           canvas {
               background-color: #000;
               display: block;
           }
       </style>
   </head>
   <body>
       <canvas></canvas>
       <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) in the same directory as the HTML file.

4. Copy the JavaScript code provided in your project into the `script.js` file.

5. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the side-scrolling game in action.

## Usage

To play the side-scrolling game:

- Use the "A" key to move the player character to the left.
- Use the "D" key to move the player character to the right.
- Use the "W" key to make the player character jump.

The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level by navigating the player character across the platforms. Avoid falling off the platforms or colliding with obstacles.

## Features

- Player Character: Control a player character using keyboard inputs to move left, right, and jump.
- Platforms: Platforms are displayed on the screen for the player character to jump on and navigate.
- Collision Detection: Detect collisions between the player character and platforms to handle movements and prevent falling through.
- Side-Scrolling: The game environment scrolls horizontally as the player character moves, simulating a side-scrolling experience.
- Win Condition: Display a "You Win!" message when the player character reaches a certain point in the level.

## Technologies Used

The SideScrolling JavaScript Project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5 Canvas: Used to create the game environment and render the player character and platforms.
- CSS: Used to style the HTML page and canvas.
- JavaScript: Used to handle player movements, collisions, and game logic.
